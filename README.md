# hand-gesture-recognition-using-mediapipe
Estimate hand pose using MediaPipe (Python version).<br>
This is a sample program that recognizes ASL(American Sign Language) alphabets with a simple MLP using the detected key points.

This repository contains the following contents.
* Sample program
* Hand sign recognition model(TFLite)
* Learning data for hand sign recognition and notebook for learning
* Learning data for finger gesture recognition and notebook for learning

# Requirements
* mediapipe 0.8.1
* OpenCV 3.4.2 or Later
* Tensorflow 2.3.0 or Later<br>tf-nightly 2.5.0.dev or later (Only when creating a TFLite for an LSTM model)
* scikit-learn 0.23.2 or Later (Only if you want to display the confusion matrix) 
* matplotlib 3.3.2 or Later (Only if you want to display the confusion matrix)

# Demo
Here's how to run the demo using your webcam.
```bash
python app.py
```

### app.py
This is a sample program for inference.<br>
In addition, learning data (key points) for hand sign recognition,<br>
You can also collect training data (index finger coordinate history) for finger gesture recognition.

### keypoint_classification.ipynb
This is a model training script for hand sign recognition.

### point_history_classification.ipynb
This is a model training script for finger gesture recognition.

### model/keypoint_classifier
This directory stores files related to hand sign recognition.<br>
The following files are stored.
* Training data(keypoint.csv)
* Trained model(keypoint_classifier.tflite)
* Label data(keypoint_classifier_label.csv)
* Inference module(keypoint_classifier.py)

## Different modes in app.py 
* Press 1 to enter logging mode which generates the training data for training the model. This appends the training data to 'keypoint.csv' file.
*
